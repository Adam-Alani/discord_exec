# discord_exec
 Execute simple python code on discord

## Why?
Well, I made this bot in 20 minutes to show my very very very beginner friends some tutorials and the basics of python, its also handy to have on our server since some of the more experienced programmer cant be asked to open up an editor everytime they want to show code that to quote Thorsten Ball: « needs pen, paper and the sentence "actually, its pretty easy to explain"»

## Syntax:
Just do:
````
```py
ur code in here
```
````

## Attention:
This bot uses the exec function which is evil and can be used to destroy your pc and everything you love so use on guilds you trust
